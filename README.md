# Sensorama.org Artwork

This repo has artwork for Sensorama (http://www.sensorama.org). Artwork is
made in Sketch (https://www.sketchapp.com/) You must have it installed, and
the free trial version is fine.

To make this repo work, you must install `sketchtool`, the command line
helper to Sketch. Run:

```
/Applications/Sketch.app/Contents/Resources/sketchtool/install.sh
```

These are Sensorama brand colors:

- Background: `#C51162`
